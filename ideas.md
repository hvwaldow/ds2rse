Data-focused RSE Data-focused RSEs work at the flourishing intersection between data science and RSE. They are additionally skilled in cleaning data and/or running data analyses and can help researchers in setting up their analysis pipeline and/or RDM solutions. When the field requires research on sensitive data or information, e.g., patient information in medicine, this RSE should have knowledge about secure transfer methods and/or ways to anonymise the data. As part of RDM, this RSE profile is able to support all stages of the research data life cycle,63 with synchronous data management processes. Those processes implement established best practices for planning and documenting of data acquisition in a data management plan (DMP), as well as for management, storage, and preservation of data, and publication and sharing of data in repositories according to the FAIR principles.96
