    \section{RSE and DS embeddings in the Research
    Cycle}\label{rse-and-ds-embeddings-in-the-research-cycle}

    Both RSE and DS can be conceptualized as a cross-cutting concern in
    many disciplines. However, the definition and relevance of these
    issues can be generalized based on the function they fulfill in the
    research cycle Figure~\ref{fig-research_cycle}.

    \newpage

    \begin{figure}

    \centering{

    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{img/research_cycle_wildt.png}

    }

    \caption{\label{fig-research_cycle}The research cycle
    \autocite{wildt2009forschendes} integrates the typical research
    process with the learning process.}

    \end{figure}%

    There are different research processes depending on the discipline
    and the research question. However, \autocite{Dehne2021} showed that
    most of the research processes contain the following phases:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
    \tightlist
    \item
      conceptualization (developing research questions, concepts)
    \item
      design (developing the tools, instruments and concrete process
      models)
    \item
      implementation (executing the experiment, study)
    \item
      analysis \& interpretation
    \item
      dissemination (publishing, distributing, peer-review)
    \item
      reflexion and improvements
    \end{enumerate}

    For example, in the case of the field of learning technologies, the
    design phase often consists of extensive software development of
    different tools for learning. In this situation developing complex
    tools for learning can be considered as research software
    engineering. The analysis of what learners can gain from using these
    technologies can be conceived as an educational research in its own
    right. This example highlights the differences of scale in both the
    weight of the different process phases (here: phase 2) and the
    relevance of research engineering. It also shows a situation where
    research software engineering clearly differs from data science. A
    typical data science background would not enable researchers to
    build full-stack software that solves inefficiencies or
    hard-to-teach problems in education.

    In the second example a GPT-like attention model is trained to
    classify data gained from the James-Webb telescope. Due to vast
    amounts of data and the continuous stream of new data research
    software engineering is needed to implement a pipeline for data
    cleaning, data warehousing and in-time analysis. In this case, the
    analysis \& interpretation phase (4) has much more relevance.
    Another point of this is example is that data science competencies
    such as vectorization of algorithms, statistical analysis, machine
    learning etc. are interconnected with competencies from software
    engineering such as software architectures, software project
    management, and database programming. In this case the distinction
    between DS competencies and RSE competencies is very fluid.

    The main argument behind these examples is that data science and
    research software engineering have a lot in common in terms of
    software development for science but show major differences where
    they are placed in the research process. This reframes the questions
    like ``how much programming is in DS'' or ``how much engineering is
    in RSE'' to a more structured approach of which cross-cutting
    functions exist in the research cycle that require computational
    means and which functions are part of the core identity of data
    scientists or research software engineers.

    As a working hypothesis based on the example above and experience in
    the field we assume the following: {[}H1{]} RSE focuses more on
    concept development (if the research is computationally heavy),
    design, implementation and dissemination, i.e.~phases 1,2,3,6
    whereas DS focuses more on analysis, interpretation and
    dissemination (phases 4,5,6). Moreover, a second hypothesis would be
    that RSE often plays a role in shaping the context of the research
    {[}H2a{]}, such as integrating projects with similar concerns, open
    source development and institutional needs. In contrast, data
    science is exclusively embedded in the research {[}H2b{]}.

    The focal point of the following chapter will revisiting existing
    ideas for DS and RSE curricula and map the competences outlined
    there to the phases in the research process. This should give the
    abstract discussion above empirical grounding and can be used to
    test the hypothesis.

    \section{DS and RSE Competences in relation to the Research
    Cycle}\label{ds-and-rse-competences-in-relation-to-the-research-cycle}

    In the following the contents of \autocite{GI2021DataScience} and
    \autocite{petersen_2025_15025246} are parsed as the most current
    examples of data science curricula in the German research context.
    The contents are inspected for obvious links to the research process
    and interpreted if no explicit connections are made.

    For the RSE side the contents of \autocite{Goth2024RSE} are used as
    a basis as well as the current state of the
    \href{https://github.com/juliandehne/RSE-Masters/blob/main/curriculum.md}{RSE-Curriculums
