# What has been discussed

When discussing competences for research software engineers as the basis of a curriculum to train Research Software engineers (RSE) professionals it is logical to look at the data science movement for inspiration. Similar to RSE, Data Science (DS) is a cross-cutting field that focuses on a special area within the sciences or data oriented businesses.

The major computing organizations ACM and IEEE published a joint recommended computing curriculum which already included data science: the [cc2020 Computing Curriculum](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/education/curricula-recommendations/cc2020.pdf) already lists DS as one of the special cases for computing competences. Whilst DS is mentioned, research software engineering was absent.

Even though it is intuitively clear that RSE is not a subclass of DS, there have been few attempts of differentiating the fields with regard to their competency sets.

TODO insert previous research to RSE and DS:
Levels of Differences between RSE and DS:

- institutional
- disciplinary connections
- target groups
- political history
